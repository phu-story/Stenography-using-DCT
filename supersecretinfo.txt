The basic intuition behind gradient descent can be illustrated by a hypothetical scenario. People are stuck in the mountains and are trying to get down (i.e., trying to find the global minimum). There is heavy fog such that visibility is extremely low. Therefore, the path down the mountain is not visible, so they must use local information to find the minimum. They can use the method of gradient descent, which involves looking at the steepness of the hill at their current position, then proceeding in the direction with the steepest descent (i.e., downhill). If they were trying to find the top of the mountain (i.e., the maximum), then they would proceed in the direction of steepest ascent (i.e., uphill). Using this method, they would eventually find their way down the mountain or possibly get stuck in some hole (i.e., local minimum or saddle point), like a mountain lake. However, assume also that the steepness of the hill is not immediately obvious with simple observation, but rather it requires a sophisticated instrument to measure, which the people happen to have at that moment. It takes quite some time to measure the steepness of the hill with the instrument. Thus, they should minimize their use of the instrument if they want to get down the mountain before sunset. The difficulty then is choosing the frequency at which they should measure the steepness of the hill so as not to go off track. In this analogy, the people represent the algorithm, and the path taken down the mountain represents the sequence of parameter settings that the algorithm will explore. The steepness of the hill represents the slope of the function at that point. The instrument used to measure steepness is differentiation. The direction they choose to travel in aligns with the gradient of the function at that point. The amount of time they travel before taking another measurement is the step size.
